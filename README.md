Aim Trainer Game:

Overview

This aim trainer is a Python-based application built using Pygame designed to help improve players' mouse accuracy and reaction speed. With these skills being 
directly applied to many other games, players may use this application to strengthen their abilities for other games.
In this game, targets will appear randomly on the screen, and your goal is to click on them as quickly as possible. However, be careful to avoid clicking
on the bombs that occasionally appear as hitting a bomb will end the game.
